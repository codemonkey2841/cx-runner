This project expounds on [a previous project of mine](https://github.com/codemonkey2841/AA-CX-Bot) written in Perl.  The objective of this iteration of the project was to:

1. See if I could efficiently rewrite it in Python as opposed to Perl.
2. Add mapping functionality so that the bot was locationally aware of itself, allowing it to get from anywhere to anywhere else with out explicit instruction.


**Note:** This project is currently in limbo because my dev box has been flagged by Ancient Anguish and I can't connect from it, so I've been stalling until I can figure out an indefinite workaround.
